	<h1>Software I recommend</h1>
	Here are a few common tasks for most students and academics, along with the
	programs I recommend for them.  All are free (as in speech) unless stated
	otherwise.  Not all of these are
	<a href="https://codeberg.org/coolcuber/coolcuber-nixos" target="_blank">things I use daily</a>,
	and some aren't even my favorite in their categories, but they are pieces
	of software that I always recommend highly.<br>
	<br>
