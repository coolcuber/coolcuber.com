	<h1>Software I recommend</h1>
	Here are a few common tasks for most students and academics, along with the programs I recommend for them.  All are free (as in speech) unless stated otherwise.  Not all of these are things I use daily, and some aren't even my favorite in their categories, but they are pieces of software that I always recommend highly.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Calculator/CAS:</b> <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sagemath</a><br>
	&bull; Built on top of Python<br>
	&bull; Good for quick calculations and detailed computations<br>
	&bull; Easy symbolic computation<br>
	&bull; Has convenient representations of most common algebraic structures<br>
	<br>
	<b>Text editing:</b> <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a><br>
	&bull; Modal text editor<br>
	&bull; Highly customizable<br>
	&bull; Dedicated online community<br>
	&bull; Wildly efficient (once you get used to it)<br>
	<br>
	<b>Reading PDFs:</b> <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">Zathura</a><br>
	&bull; Lightweight<br>
	&bull; Vim-like commands/navigation<br>
	&bull; Distraction-free experience<br>
	<br>
	<b>Annotating PDFs (drawing):</b> <a href=https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a><br>
	&bull; Very easy to use<br>
	&bull; Provides basic tools to draw, overlay text, or create shapes on a new or existing PDF<br>
	&bull; Works great in lecture environments<br>
